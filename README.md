## Project Description:
- In this Project, a website page was developed, a Front-End project, using HTML, CSS, Java Script, and the Materialize Framework.
On the page we find a more advanced Design, using the Materialize tools. We also found a modal initially to put the E-mail,
when we go down the screen we find the author and message of the day, as well as images and descriptions of the best places to visit on a trip, and to learn more about
the trips, prices, and the whole process, we have a contact with the team.

- The Project has the functionality of showing a Travel Agency page and places to visit, and a whole team to help, in a Front-End environment.

- Below is a short instructional video where we show an example of how the Places and Travel page works.
